Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe Game Web project! This is a simple yet interactive web-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game is designed with a modern Google UI/UX, featuring animations and vibrations to enhance the user experience.

## Features

- **Score Counter:** The game tracks and displays the score for each player.
- **Alternate Starting Player:** Each new game alternates the starting player.
- **Animations:** Winning moves are highlighted with smooth animations.
- **Vibration Feedback:** Device vibration is triggered upon each click (for supporting devices).
- **Responsive Design:** The game is fully responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure of the game.
- **CSS3**: Styling the game with Google UI/UX, animations, and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Game logic, handling user interactions, animations, and vibration feedback.
